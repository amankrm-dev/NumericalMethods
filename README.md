<h1>Numerical Methods in C</h1>

This repository is a structured collection of C programs implementing core Numerical Methods. Code is added progressively as topics are covered.

<h3>ðŸ“‚ Repository Overview</h3>
This repository includes:
<br>
1. Root-finding methods: Bisection, False Position (Regula Falsi), Newtonâ€“Raphson, Secant. <br>
2. Interpolation: Newtonâ€™s Forward/Backward, Lagrange. <br>
3. Numerical differentiation & integration: Finite differences, Trapezoidal, Simpsonâ€™s rules. <br>
4. Systems of linear equations: Gauss Elimination, Gaussâ€“Jordan, Jacobi, Gaussâ€“Seidel. <br>
5. Curve fitting, least squares, and other numerical utilities.
